- Keep Lovable AI Gateway calls in authenticated server functions with provider setup isolated in `*.server.ts`; this protects keys and enforces student access.
- Keep AI chat threads in browser storage with route-derived thread IDs, while streaming model calls through an authenticated server route; this preserves private multi-thread navigation without database persistence.
